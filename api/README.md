# Helios Server


## Compiling
This is used for building the release but can also be used for development:

    git clone git@github.com:begizi/helios-server.git
    cd helios-server && make build
    ./bin/helios


## Auto Compile (for rapid development)

Use the serve build command to auto compile when changes are made:

    make serve
